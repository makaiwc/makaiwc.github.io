<i>Body</i>, November 2015<br> 
	Oil on nylon and canvas; 40" x 12" <br>
	<i>Body</i> was created in response to the parallel between canvas stretched over wood and skin stretched over bones. If the three dimensional structure of paintings is considered, paintings move from image into sculpture, and the physical intrusion of their presence is realized. To express this, I created a sculpture of a "canvas organism" with the stretcher as its skeleton and paint as its skin. The paint rests on a nylon layer that is slashed in order to reveal the natural canvas underneath. The painted image is based on an enlarged, high contrast photograph of plain canvas, and rendered in the primary colors, and so it is an image of a painting's DNA. The pattern may conjure leopard skin or chromosomes.  </p>
